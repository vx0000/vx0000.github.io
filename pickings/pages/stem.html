			sinensis - MHNT Toona sinensis, commonly called Chinese mahogany,[2]
			Chinese cedar, Chinese toon, beef and onion plant,[3] or red toon
			(Chinese: 香椿; pinyin: xiāngchūn; Hindi: डारलू, romanized: d̩āralū; Malay:
			suren; Vietnamese: hương xuân) is a species of Toona native to eastern and
			southeastern Asia, from North Korea south through most of eastern, central
			and southwestern China to Nepal, northeastern India, Myanmar, Thailand,
			Malaysia, and western Indonesia.[4][5][6][7][8] Characteristics Leaf
			(unusual specimen with terminal leaflet) Toona sinensis young leaves It is
			a deciduous tree growing to 25 metres (82 ft) tall with a trunk up to 70
			cm diameter. The bark is brown, smooth on young trees, becoming scaly to
			shaggy on old trees. The leaves are pinnate, 50–70 cm long and 30–40 cm
			broad, with 10–40 leaflets, the terminal leaflet usually absent
			(paripinnate) but sometimes present (imparipennate); the individual
			leaflets 9–15 cm long and 2.5–4 cm broad, with an entire or weakly
			serrated margin. The young leaves are reddish-brown or purple, and have a
			smell. The flowers are produced in summer in panicles 30–50 cm long at the
			end of a branch; each flower is small, 4–5 mm diameter, with five white or
			pale pink petals. The fruit is a golden capsule 2–3.5 cm long, containing
			several winged seeds.[4][7][8][9] It is similar to Ailanthus altissima in
			appearance, but their leaves smell differently. Toona has rough bark,
			while A. altissima has smooth bark. Cultivation Toona sinensis can
			reproduce both sexually and asexually, including seed propagation, cutting
			propagation and tissue culture. Seed propagation can provide large
			quantity of seedlings, which is suitable for the need of mass cultivation.
			Seeds soaked in warm water for a moderate amount of time before sowing are
			more likely to germinate. Normally, seeds of T. sinensis are sowed between
			the late March and early April in East Asia, and the time may vary
			depending on the actual planting area. Saplings grown from seeds in spring
			can be transplanted with leaves in fall.[10] Cutting propagation uses a
			piece of stem or root of mature plant to grow a new plant in media like
			moist soil. This method has a higher survival rate in saplings than other
			methods. Usually semi-lignified stems are used in planting because those
			that have undergone full lignification process are hard to take root or
			root slowly and stems that have not lignified are easy to decay after
			planting. NAA or Vitamin D solutions can help with the rooting of cut
			stems. Normally, T. sinensis stems are cut from mature plant and
			cultivated between late June and early July in East Asia, and time may
			differ depending on the actual planting area.[10] Tissue culture of T.
			sinensis starts from late 1980s in China. Successful cases include the
			culture of T. sinensis seedlings on MS medium together with IAA and BA
			hormones. Since 1980s, researches have collected stems of mature T.
			sinensis trees from different regions and build a set of method specific
			for the tissue culture of rare variety of Toona sinensis.[11] Uses Food
			and Nutritions The young leaves of T. sinensis are extensively used as a
			vegetable in China; they have a floral, yet onion-like flavor, attributed
			to volatile organosulfur compounds.[12] Plants with red young leaves are
			considered of better flavour than those where the young leaves are
			green.[4][13][14] In China and Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia,
			the young leaves of Toona sinensis or commonly known as Chinese Mahogany
			is used to make Toona paste, which is used as a condiment to serve with
			plain rice porridge as breakfast and simple meals, or to enhance the
			flavour of a dish or soup. Common dishes made with Toona paste are Chinese
			Mahogany fried rice, Chinese Mahogany beancurd, and Chinese Mahogany
			mushroom soup. The leaves contain Vitamin E, and high amounts of iron,
			calcium and chlorophyll.[15] Material The timber is hard and reddish; it
			is valuable, used for furniture making[4][9] and for bodies of electric
			guitars, as a common (and substantially cheaper) replacement for Swietenia
			mahogany ("true mahogany"), which is now commercially restricted from
			being sourced natively.[16] Outside its native region T. sinensis is
			valued more as a large ornamental tree for its haggard aspect.[8][17] It
			is by far the most cold-tolerant species in the Meliaceae and the only
			member of the family that can be cultivated successfully in northern
			Europe. Medicine According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the
			leaves of T. sinensis are beneficial for digestion and cough problems, and
			can help to stop bleeding.[18] Recent researches find out that
			polysaccharides contained in T. sinensis leaves can protect liver cells in
			high-fat or high-carbohydrate diets.[19][20] Quercetrin extracted from
			leaves is found to be one of natural antioxidant, and can act as an
			anticancer agent in breast, colon, prostate, ovary, endometrium, and lung
			tumor.[21] Potential danger The leaves of T. sinensis has a relative high
			content of nitrite, which is about 157 to 160 mg/kg.[22] However, after
			boiling with water, the amount of nitrite left is only about 7 mg/kg,
			which is safe to eat. Because the content of nitrite will increase as time
			passes, T. sinensis leaves are not suitable for long time storage. The
			bark of Chinese Toon tree The quercetrin contained in T. sinensis leaves
			can induce cell cycle arrest and lead to apoptosis of cells. Research on
			T. sinensis continues and more findings may be announced.[23] Culture
			<strong
				>In Chinese literature, Toona sinensis is often used symbolically, with
				a mature tree representing a father. This manifests itself occasionally
				when expressing best wishes to a friend's father and mother in a letter,
				where one can write "wishing your Toona sinensis and daylily are strong
				and happy" (simplified Chinese: 椿萱并茂; traditional Chinese: 椿萱並茂;
				pinyin: chūnxuānbìngmào), with Toona sinensis metaphorically referring
				to the father and daylily to the mother.</strong
